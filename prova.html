<p>At twenty-two,
    <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> (January 8, 1942&ndash;March 14, 2018) was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis &#8212;
    a rare motor disease &#8212; and given a few years to live. He lived for more than half a century thereafter. Despite
    the increasing bodily limitations inflicted by the incurable disease, he went on to soar with a limitless mind that has
    impacted the course of modern physics perhaps more profoundly than any scientist since Albert Einstein. His theory of
    what is now known as Hawking radiation &#8212; the thermal electromagnetic radiation which quantum phenomena on the event
    horizon cause a black hole to emit &#8212; revolutionized our understanding of the most powerful objects in the known
    universe and,
    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/25/black-hole-blues-janna-levin-joseph-weber/">in consequence</a>, of the universe itself. His pursuit of a
    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/09/25/stephen-hawking-made-simple-animation/">&#8220;theory of everything&#8221;</a> adrenalized the scientific community and his landmark 1988 book
    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/10/17/7-must-read-books-on-time/">
        <em>A Brief History of Time</em>
    </a> awakened generations of lay readers to the splendor of physics, welding science to the rest of culture.</p>

<p>A different, complementary, more existential side of Hawking comes alive in an interview conducted shortly after the release
    of
    <em>A Brief History of Time</em> and found in the out-of-print treasure

    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/alan-lightman/">Alan Lightman</a> and Roberta Brawer, exploring &#8220;the ways in which personal, philosophical, and social factors
    enter the scientific process,&#8221; which also gave us pioneering astronomer Vera Rubin on
    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/18/vera-rubin-interview-women-in-science/">women in science, dark matter, and our never-ending quest to know the universe</a>.</p>
<p>When asked how he would design the universe if he could design it any way he wanted, Hawking, beloved for his dry humor,
    answers:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It is like the anthropic argument: If I had designed it differently, it wouldn&#8217;t have produced me. So that is a
        meaningless question. I&#8217;m prepared to make do with the universe we have, and try to find out what it is like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning over the question of meaning to Nobel-winning physicist Steven Weinberg&#8217;s famous assertion that
    <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/01/we-are-all-stardust-steven-weinberg-interview/">&#8220;the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless,&#8221;</a> Hawking offers a laconic
    yet spirited counterpoint:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I don&#8217;t feel like that. I think that human intellectual history is a record of how we have come nearer and nearer
        to an understanding of the order in the universe. I&#8217;m proud of our achievement.</p>
